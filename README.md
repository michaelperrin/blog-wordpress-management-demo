To have a fully working Wordpress installation, just clone this project and run the following commands.

Install Wordpress:

    make wordpress_install

Configure Wordpress:

    make wordpress_configure

That's it! Wordpress was **installed** and **configured** without any manual
clicks in some interface and is now ready to be visited at http://localhost .
